\title{Class \code{"psm"}}
\description{
Class \code{"psm"} is a class for outputs of Price Sensitivity Meter analyses as performed by the \code{\link{psm_analysis}} function.

The main purpose is to create a custom \code{summary} function for objects of class \code{"psm"}.
}

\section{Objects from the Class}{
Objects are usually created as a result of a call of the \code{\link{psm_analysis}} function.
}

\section{Slots}{
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data_input}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}. Contains the data that was used as an input for the analysis.}
    \item{\code{validated}:}{Object of class \code{"logical"}. Indicates whether the \code{"validate"} option of the \code{psm_analysis} function has been used (to exclude cases with intransitive price preferences).}
    \item{\code{invalid_cases}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Number of cases with intransitive price preferences.}
    \item{\code{total_sample}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Total sample size of the input sample \emph{before} assessing the transitivity of individual price preferences.}
    \item{\code{data_vanwestendorp}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}. Output data of the Price Sensitivity Meter analysis. Contains the cumulative distribution functions for the four price assessments (too cheap, cheap, expensive, too expensive) for all prices as well as the inversed distributions "not cheap" and "not expensive" (that are required for the acceptable price range).}
    \item{\code{pricerange_lower}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Lower limit of the acceptable price range as defined by the Price Sensitivity Meter, also known as \bold{point of marginal cheapness}: Intersection of the "too cheap" and the "not cheap" curves.}
    \item{\code{pricerange_upper}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Upper limit of the acceptable price range as defined by the Price Sensitivity Meter, also known as \bold{point of marginal expensiveness}: Intersection of the "too expensive" and the "not expensive" curves.}
    \item{\code{idp}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. \bold{Indifference Price Point} as defined by the Price Sensitivity Meter: Intersection of the "cheap" and the "expensive" curves.}
    \item{\code{opp}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. \bold{Optimal Price Point} as defined by the Price Sensitivity Meter: Intersection of the "too cheap" and the "too expensive" curves.}
    \item{\code{NMS}:}{Object of class \code{"logical"}. Indicates whether the additional analyses of the Newton Miller Smith Extension were performed.}
    \item{\code{data_nms}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}. Output of the Newton Miller Smith extension: calibrated mean purchase probabilities for each price point.}
    \item{\code{pi_scale}:}{Object of class \code{"data.frame"}. Shows the values of the purchase intent variable and the corresponding calibrated purchase probabilities as defined in the function input for the Newton Miller Smith extension.}
    \item{\code{price_optimal_trial}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Output of the Newton Miller Smith extension: Estimate for the price with the highest trial rate.}
    \item{\code{price_optimal_revenue}:}{Object of class \code{"numeric"}. Output of the Newton Miller Smith extension: Estimate for the price with the highest revenue (based on the trial rate).}
